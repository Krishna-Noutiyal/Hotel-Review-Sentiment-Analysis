# Hotel Review Sentiment Analysis

Welcome to the **Hotel Review Sentiment Analysis** repository! This project involves training Machine Learning models using a dataset of over 300 authentic hotel reviews to predict overall ratings and generate insightful visualizations.  

This repository is structured to support ease of understanding, scalability, and modularity. It includes datasets, trained models, and a Jinja2-based visualization application.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

### **Folders**
1. **`data`**  
   Contains datasets used for training and testing the ML models. The data is clean, structured, and ready for model consumption.  
   - **Purpose**: To store and organize the data in CSV or other relevant formats.

2. **`models`**  
   Includes trained models along with their corresponding feature files (`.pkl`) for consistency and reuse.  
   - **Purpose**: To save pre-trained ML models for reuse and evaluation without retraining.

3. **`output`**  
   Houses HTML files generated via the Jinja2 application for visualizing the model's predictions.  
   - **Purpose**: To provide a user-friendly, well-formatted summary of the results.

4. **`template`**  
   Contains Jinja2 templates used to generate HTML files in the `output` folder.  
   - **Purpose**: To ensure separation of content (data) and presentation (HTML formatting).

### **Files**
- **`filtering.py`**: Prepares and filters raw data for model input.  
- **`processing.py`**: Handles data transformation, normalization, and scaling.  
- **`analytics.py`**: Generates analytical insights, including metrics like accuracy and precision.  
- **`reviews.py`**: Generates detailed reviews (long or short) based on predictions.  
- **`output.py`**: Saves or displays the output of the model predictions.  
- **`testing.py`**: Facilitates model testing and evaluation.  
- **`train_model.py`**: Contains code for training the ML models and saving them for later use.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Libraries: Install dependencies from `req.txt`:
  ```bash
  pip install -r req.txt
  ```

### Running the Project
1. **Train the Model**: Use `training.py` to train the model with data from the `data` folder.
2. **Test the Model**: Run `testing.py` to evaluate the model and generate reviews.
3. **Visualize Results**: Check the `output` folder for beautifully formatted HTML files showing predictions.

---

## üìä Example Workflow
1. Place your dataset in the `data` folder.  
2. Train your model using:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. Test the model with:
   ```bash
   python testing.py
   ```
4. Open the generated HTML files in the `output` folder for a detailed visualization of the predictions.
